# ðŸ“š DSA Roadmap in Java

Welcome to my **DSA Roadmap** repository! This repo contains a **comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms problems** implemented in **Java**, organized from **beginner to advanced topics**.

This roadmap is designed to help **prepare for coding interviews**, placements, and enhance problem-solving skills.

## **How to Use This Repo**
1. Navigate to a folder to explore problems of that topic.  
2. Each problem is implemented in a **separate `.java` file**.  
3. Each folder contains a **README.md** summarizing all problems and solutions in that folder.  
4. Optional: Visualizations folder contains **diagrams and GIFs** to help understand algorithms.
