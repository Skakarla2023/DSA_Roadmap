# Linked List

### Differences between ArrayList and LinkedList


|Aspects                    |ArrayList                                            | Linked List                                                  |
----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Size**                  | Fixed Size                                          | Variable Size, you can add as many elements as you want. |
|**Insertion in the middle**| Takes O(n) to do that                               | Inserts elements in between in constant(O(1)) time.          |
|**Search(Time complexity)**| Takes O(1) time.                                    | Takes O(n) time.                                             |
| **Suggested when**        | Search operations are there.                        | There are manipulation operations like insert or delete etc. |
| **Memory**                | Array elements are stored in contiguous memory.     | Linked list elements are stored in non-contiguous memory.    |
