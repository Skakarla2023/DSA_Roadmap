# Functions

- Function is a  block of code.
- It takes some input, performs an operation and gives output.

- Observe the following basic java code:
```java
public class Main
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    System.out.println("Hello world.");
  }
}
```

- In the above code, **public**,**static**,**void**,**main** : all these are keywords.
  - public: The method can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
  - static: The function can be called without using an  object.
  - void: meaning the function returns nothing
  - main  : it is like the starting part or entry point of the program.
