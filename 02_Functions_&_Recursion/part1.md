# üåü Functions

- Function is a  block of code.
- It takes some input, performs an operation and gives output.

- Observe the following basic java code:
```java
public class Main
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    System.out.println("Hello world.");
  }
}
```

- In the above code, **public**,**static**,**void**,**main** : all these are keywords.
  - public: The method can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
  - static: The function can be called without using an  object.
  - void: meaning the function returns nothing
  - main  : it is like the starting part or entry point of the program.
 

 ### ‚òëÔ∏è Rules for functions

 - Function names must start with alphabets or underscore.
 - Function names cannot be keywords in java.
 - Functions names can be written using three cases in java.They are:
    - Camel Case: fist word starts with Lowercase letter and all the consecutive words in the function name start with Upper case letter.(eg:myFunctionName)\
    - Snake Case:in snake case we use underscores to seperate each word.(eg:my_function_name)
    - Pascal Case:It is a general case, where the function name will be in lowercase.
